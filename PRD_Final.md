## 1. Introduction/Overview

ThriftChain is a next-generation peer-to-peer resale and trade marketplace built on the Sui blockchain to empower users directly—eliminating unnecessary fees, middlemen, and control from centralized platforms. The goal is to create a **trust-first, AI-personalized trading economy** where users can buy, sell, or trade items seamlessly.

### Core Problem
Traditional marketplace platforms present significant challenges for users:
- **High Fees & Lost Earnings:** Traditional platforms take 10–30% in fees, drastically reducing user profit
- **Centralized Control:** Platforms decide who sees what, forcing users to pay to boost visibility
- **Lack of Trust Between Strangers:** Buyers fear scams; sellers fear chargebacks or non-payment
- **Poor User Experience in Discovery:** Users scroll endlessly through generic listings instead of seeing items truly relevant to them

However, users face challenges:
- Complex blockchain interactions
- Need for secure transaction mechanisms
- Requirement for personalized discovery

### Our Solution
ThriftChain creates a **peer-powered economy** where users keep what they earn, control their deals, and interact in a fair system where safety and relevance are built in—not added on.

### Blockchain/Architecture Clarification

**IMPORTANT**: ThriftChain is built on Sui blockchain for fast, low-cost transactions with built-in escrow capabilities.

We handle:
- ✅ Peer-to-peer transactions with smart contract escrow
- ✅ AI-powered item discovery and matching
- ✅ Real-time bidding and negotiation
- ✅ Low-fee economic model (minimal platform overhead)

We do NOT handle:
- ❌ Traditional payment processing (credit cards, bank transfers)
- ❌ Centralized inventory management
- ❌ Complex KYC/AML compliance (beyond basic wallet verification)

**Primary Goal:** Launch a functional MVP demonstrating core peer-to-peer trading with AI personalization within 48 hours.

## 9. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Critical Path Protection

The transaction flow MUST work flawlessly. All error handling focuses on this path:

```typescript
// Transaction flow with comprehensive error handling
class TransactionFlow {
  private readonly criticalPath = [
    'walletConnection', 'offerCreation', 'escrowSetup', 'transactionExecution'
  ];
  
  async executeTransaction(offer: Offer): Promise<TransactionResult> {
    try {
      await this.validateWalletConnection();
      await this.createEscrowContract(offer);
      await this.executePayment(offer);
      return { success: true, transactionId: offer.id };
    } catch (error) {
      await this.handleTransactionError(error, offer);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Blockchain Errors

#### Network Connection Issues
```typescript
enum BlockchainError {
  NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE = 'NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE',
  INSUFFICIENT_GAS = 'INSUFFICIENT_GAS',
  TRANSACTION_FAILED = 'TRANSACTION_FAILED'
}

const blockchainErrorHandlers: Record<BlockchainError, () => void> = {
  [BlockchainError.NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE]: () => {
    showError('Network connection lost. Please check your internet connection.');
  },
  [BlockchainError.INSUFFICIENT_GAS]: () => {
    showError('Insufficient gas for transaction. Please add more SUI to your wallet.');
  },
  [BlockchainError.TRANSACTION_FAILED]: () => {
    showError('Transaction failed. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

### Wallet Connection Issues

```typescript
class WalletService {
  async connectWallet(): Promise<WalletConnection> {
    // Retry strategy with exponential backoff
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
      try {
        const wallet = await this.detectWallet();
        return await wallet.connect();
      } catch (err) {
        if (attempt === 3) throw new WalletConnectionError(err);
        await sleep(attempt * 1000);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### User-Facing Error Messages

| Error Code | User Message | Technical Cause | Recovery Action |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| WALLET_NOT_FOUND | "Please install a Sui wallet to continue" | No wallet detected | Install wallet |
| INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS | "Insufficient SUI for transaction" | Low wallet balance | Add funds to wallet |
| TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT | "Transaction is taking longer than expected" | Network congestion | Wait or retry |
| ESCROW_FAILED | "Unable to create secure transaction" | Smart contract error | Contact support |

2. How should we handle image optimization before uploading to Walrus?
3. What's the optimal gas fee structure for our escrow contracts?
4. How can we implement real-time features without WebSocket infrastructure?
5. What level of AI personalization is feasible within the time constraint?
6. Should we use Walrus CLI or SDK for image uploads in the web app?
