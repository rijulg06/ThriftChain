# Testing Documentation

This directory contains testing instructions for each task in the ThriftChain MVP implementation.

> **ðŸ“– For a comprehensive guide on using these tests, see:** `../TESTING-GUIDE.md`

## Structure

Each testing file follows the naming convention: `[task-number]-testing.md`

Examples:
- `1.1-testing.md` - Testing instructions for Task 1.1
- `1.2-testing.md` - Testing instructions for Task 1.2
- `1.3-testing.md` - Testing instructions for Task 1.3

## Purpose

These testing documents provide:
1. **Step-by-step verification** of task completion
2. **Expected outputs** for each verification step
3. **Success criteria** checklist
4. **Troubleshooting** guides for common issues
5. **Next steps** pointing to the subsequent task

## How to Use

1. Complete the task as described in `tasks-PRD_Final.md`
2. Follow the corresponding testing instructions in this directory
3. Verify each step before marking the task complete
4. Proceed to the next task only after passing all tests

## Current Testing Documents

- âœ… `1.1-testing.md` - Install Supabase dependencies
- âœ… `1.2-testing.md` - Create Supabase project and environment variables
- âœ… `1.3-testing.md` - Create database schema

## Testing Philosophy

Each test verifies:
- **Correctness**: The implementation works as specified
- **Integration**: Components integrate with existing infrastructure
- **Security**: Security measures are properly configured
- **Documentation**: Changes are properly documented

## Notes

- All tests are designed to be run by human developers
- Tests include both automated checks (scripts) and manual verification
- Troubleshooting sections help resolve common issues
- Tests are cumulative - later tasks may depend on earlier tasks passing
