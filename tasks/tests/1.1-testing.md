# Task 1.1 Testing Instructions
## Create Move contract directory structure

### Prerequisites
- Sui CLI installed and working
- Project directory structure exists
- Access to terminal/command line

---

## Step 1: Verify Directory Structure

1. **Action:** Navigate to contracts directory and check structure
2. **Command:** `cd contracts/marketplace && ls -la`
3. **Expected output:**
   ```
   total 0
   drwxrwxrwx 1 rohinsood rohinsood 4096 Oct 25 04:39 .
   drwxrwxrwx 1 rohinsood rohinsood 4096 Oct 25 04:39 ..
   -rwxrwxrwx 1 rohinsood rohinsood  301 Oct 25 04:48 Move.toml
   drwxrwxrwx 1 rohinsood rohinsood 4096 Oct 25 04:39 sources
   ```
4. **Verification:** Directory structure exists with Move.toml and sources/ directory

---

## Step 2: Verify Move.toml Configuration

1. **Action:** Check Move.toml file contents
2. **Command:** `cat Move.toml`
3. **Expected output:**
   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "ThriftChain"
   version = "0.1.0"
   published-at = ""

   [addresses]
   thriftchain = "_"

   [dev-addresses]
   thriftchain = "0x0"

   [dependencies]
   Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/mainnet" }
   ```
4. **Verification:** No duplicate [package] sections, correct Sui framework dependency

---

## Step 3: Test Sui CLI Installation

1. **Action:** Verify Sui CLI is installed and working
2. **Command:** `sui --version`
3. **Expected output:** Version number (e.g., `sui 1.59.0-90f1d8e92068`)
4. **Verification:** Sui CLI responds with version information

---

## Step 4: Test Move Build (Should Fail)

1. **Action:** Attempt to build Move package (should fail without source files)
2. **Command:** `sui move build`
3. **Expected output:** Error about unresolved addresses or missing source files
4. **Verification:** Build fails as expected (this is normal without source files)

---

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Directory structure exists: `contracts/marketplace/sources/`
- [ ] Move.toml file exists with correct configuration
- [ ] No duplicate [package] sections in Move.toml
- [ ] Sui framework dependency is correctly configured
- [ ] Sui CLI is installed and working
- [ ] `sui move build` command executes (fails as expected)
- [ ] Sources directory is empty and ready for contracts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error: "sui: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Sui CLI:
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install sui

# Or download from sui.io
# Follow installation instructions for your OS
```

### Common Error: "Failed to build Move modules: Unresolved addresses"
**Solution:** This is expected without source files. The error confirms the build system is working.

### Common Error: "Duplicate [package] section in Move.toml"
**Solution:** Remove duplicate sections, keep only one [package] section with all required fields.

## Next Steps

After completing Task 1.1, proceed to **Task 1.2**: Write `thriftchain.move` - ThriftItem struct & create_item function

The directory structure is now ready for writing Move smart contracts.
