echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  DESIGN LIMITATION DETECTED"
echo ""
echo "üìã Analysis:"
echo "  The current smart contract design does NOT include:"
echo "  1. Timeout functionality for escrows"
echo "  2. Automatic refund mechanisms"
echo "  3. Time-based escrow expiration"
echo ""
echo "üîç Current Implementation:"
echo "  - Escrow has 'created_at' and 'completed_at' timestamps"
echo "  - No 'expires_at' field"
echo "  - No functions to check or enforce timeout"
echo "  - No keeper/cron mechanism to trigger auto-refunds"
echo ""
echo "üí° What would be needed:"
echo "  1. Add 'expires_at: u64' field to Escrow struct"
echo "  2. Add 'timeout_refund()' function that:"
echo "     - Checks if current_time > expires_at"
echo "     - Refunds buyer if timeout reached"
echo "     - Can be called by anyone (keeper pattern)"
echo "  3. Optionally: Sui's Move doesn't have cron jobs, so this would need:"
echo "     - Off-chain keeper service"
echo "     - Or manual timeout claims"
echo ""
echo "üéØ Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED"
echo "   This feature requires contract upgrades and is outside"
echo "   the current scope of the escrow system."
