echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  DESIGN LIMITATION DETECTED"

echo "üìã Analysis:"
echo "  The current smart contract design does NOT include:"
echo "  1. Platform fee collection"
echo "  2. Fee distribution logic"
echo "  3. Treasury or platform wallet"
echo ""
echo "üîç Current Implementation:"
echo "  - Escrow struct only has 'amount: u64'"
echo "  - No 'platform_fee' or 'seller_amount' fields"
echo "  - confirm_delivery() emits ItemSold with full 'amount'"
echo "  - No fee splitting or deduction occurs"
echo "  - All funds conceptually go to seller (100%)"
echo ""
echo "üí° What would be needed:"
echo "  1. Add to Marketplace struct:"
echo "     - platform_fee_bps: u64 (basis points, e.g., 250 = 2.5%)"
echo "     - treasury: address (platform wallet)"
echo "  2. Add to Escrow or ItemSold event:"
echo "     - platform_fee: u64"
echo "     - seller_amount: u64"
echo "  3. Modify confirm_delivery() to:"
echo "     - Calculate: platform_fee = amount * fee_bps / 10000"
echo "     - Calculate: seller_amount = amount - platform_fee"
echo "     - Transfer platform_fee to treasury"
echo "     - Transfer seller_amount to seller"
echo ""
echo "üéØ Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED"
echo "   Fee distribution is a future feature and requires:"
echo "   - Contract upgrade to add fee fields"
echo "   - Payment splitting logic"
echo "   - Treasury management"
