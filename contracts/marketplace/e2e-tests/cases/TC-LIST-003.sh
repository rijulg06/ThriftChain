# Note: This test case requires the actual ThriftItem object, which is not accessible via CLI
# due to the smart contract design limitation. This test will demonstrate the limitation.

echo "⚠️  SMART CONTRACT DESIGN LIMITATION DETECTED"
echo ""
echo "📋 Test Requirements:"
echo "  - Function: update_item_price"
echo "  - Requires: &ThriftItem object (not just ID)"
echo "  - Current Design: Items stored in marketplace table"
echo "  - CLI Limitation: Cannot access item objects directly"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Analysis:"
echo "  ❌ Function signature: update_item_price(item: &mut ThriftItem, new_price: u64, ...)"
echo "  ❌ Problem: Requires actual ThriftItem object reference"
echo "  ❌ Current: Items stored in marketplace.items table"
echo "  ❌ CLI Limitation: Cannot pass object references via CLI"
echo ""

echo "💡 Potential Solutions:"
echo "  1. Modify smart contract to accept item IDs instead of object references"
echo "  2. Create wrapper functions that work with IDs"
echo "  3. Use a frontend application that can handle object references"
echo "  4. Implement item management through marketplace object methods"
echo ""

echo "📊 Test Results:"
echo "  ❌ Cannot execute: update_item_price requires object reference"
echo "  ❌ Smart contract design prevents CLI testing"
echo "  ⚠️  Function exists but is not accessible via CLI"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Validation:"
echo "  ❌ Test cannot be executed due to smart contract design"
echo "  ❌ Function requires object reference not available via CLI"
echo "  ⚠️  Smart contract needs modification for CLI compatibility"
echo ""

echo "📝 Test Summary:"
echo "  ❌ TC-LIST-003 CANNOT BE TESTED: Smart contract design limitation"
echo "  💡 Recommendation: Modify smart contract to support ID-based operations"
echo "  🔧 Required Changes: Update function signatures to accept item IDs"
echo ""

echo "🏁 TC-LIST-003 Test completed!"
